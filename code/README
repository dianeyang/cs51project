To make a file searchable:

python erm.py filepath
  ex: python erm.py erm_tests/Times.png
  define filepath to be the png file you want to make searchable
  
  we have included many .png files for you to use in the erm_tests folder
  if you would like to make other pngs to run our program over, the procedure is as follows:
  1) write out the text file with a certain font in Microsoft Word. Our program works best with sans-serif  
     normal-looking fonts. Please note that our program is not built to handle numbers or punctuation other 
     than periods.
  2) increase the spacing between letters. This is acheived through format --> Font --> advanced; spacing =
     expanded by 1.1. Click OK. This spacing is an invariant we assumed in our preprocessing, making it 
     easier to detect the difference between spaces between letters and spaces between words.
  3) run the word document through a png converter. We used http://docupub.com/pdfconvert/
     note that these converters sometimes do not always output the same font that is input for some reason,
     so be sure to check that.
  4) save the png output by the converter, and the path to that file is put as the argument 'filepath' above
  
  Please note that we included many different test files so you wouldn't have to go through this process; if 
  you want more tests, feel free to ask us and we can generate them for you, or you can go through the above
  process yourself. 
  
  This program will output the file searchable.txt, which should theoretically be the same letters (but in 
  reality is most of the same letters) as were in the png



To search the searchable file:

python search.py query
  ex: python search.py Hello World
  This takes in a query, which can be multiple words, and searches for it in searchable.txt, returning either
  the location of the first instance of the query, or that the query doesn't exist in the file
  Please note that our program is not built to handle numbers or punctuation other than periods.
